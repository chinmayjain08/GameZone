## Further Exploration

- Score
  - When a line is cleared, the score should increase based on the number of lines cleared at once.
  - Display a high score using [localSorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage)
- Next Piece Preview
  - Show the next piece (or pieces) that will enter the playfield. 
- Hard Drop
  - When the Space key is pressed, the piece should be placed as far down as possible. 
- Mobile and touchscreen support
  - Allow the game to be scaled down to a phone size. 
  - Support [touch controls](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Touch_events)
